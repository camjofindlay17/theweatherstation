# theweatherstation

Created a weather app to determine the current temperature of a provided zip code and also display the weather over the course of the next five days.

The user is asked to search by zip code  in order to render the weather. If a proper zip code is entered the local name will be displayed with the current date as well as key weather figures, including temperature and wind speed, as well as an icon showing the general "look" of the sky. A color display warns the user if the UV index is high based on the safety levels set by the EPA.

The user will also be shown a forecast for the next five das, displaying temperature and humidity, as well as another icon for how the sky is forecasted to appear at that time.

## Improvements

I would have liked to been able to get the Google Places API to render in the search bar in order to pull out city, state, and country data. This would have allowed me to access international weather data. The OpenWeather API also had a bulk data list, but the documentation on how to render that could not be found. In the end, the zip code feature allowed me to create a national weather portal and still render the correct data.

Additionally, I would have liked to create a callback option on the list of searches. If the user wanted to pull back up previously searched data, they could click the list item and that data would re-render.

An extra nice to have would have been a map or additional data, to fill the empty space in the current weather section.
